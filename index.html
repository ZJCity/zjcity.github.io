      <h3>Zain Jondah</h3>
      <p>
        I started learning programming in 2017 after being introduced to Python from Computer Science in secondary school.
        Since then, my reach within Computer Science expanded to the point where I became heavily interested in reverse engineering and Windows internals, becoming proficient in both C++ and Python.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the moment, I am working as a freelance developer. I reverse engineer bits of software and write frameworks for them to speed up the development process.
        Personally, I have become quite interested in malware and more specifically, networking.

    <h3>Stomper: A 2D Platformer (University)</h3>
    <p>
      My Java project is a 2D platformer game called Stomper. It is a game where you stomp on the heads of enemies and collect gems.
      This project allowed me to explore Java and it's concepts. I learned a lot about documentation through JavaDoc.
      One of the main challenges that I encountered was detecting collisions on entities that were loaded through a save file.
      I was able to fix this by using global collision handlers that the level would load.
